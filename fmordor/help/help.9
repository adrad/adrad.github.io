	WEAR <object> [#]

The wear command allows you to wear armor-like items like body-armor,
helmets, shields, gloves, sleeves, pants, etc.  If you are currently
not wearing an item on that body location, then the command will succeed
and your armor class will be adjusted accordingly.  You may enter
"wear all" causing anything in your inventory that is wearable to be
worn.

Example:

: i
You are carrying: some leather armor, some chainmail armor.
: wear armor 2
You wear some chainmail armor.
