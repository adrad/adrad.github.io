Help on spell:
	RESTORE

Syntax:
	(cannot be cast)

The restore spell is extremely useful and powerful.  Perhaps that is
why it cannot be cast by players.  It slightly heals the player who is
the target and possibly restores all magic points as well.  There are
wands and potions in the game capable of performing this spell.
