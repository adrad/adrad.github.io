	Ogres are a race of huge demihumans, second only to half-giants in
size and strength.  They are generally intolerant of other races, prefering
solitude to reign over their tiny fiefdoms, although they have been known
the form strategic alliances to further their domination of the smaller
races.  Their brutish strength is offset by their below-average intellectual
capacity.
