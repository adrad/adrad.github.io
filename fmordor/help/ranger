RANGER

	The ranger is a skillful fighter with the abilities to track
opponents, to search for hidden exits, monsters, and treasures, and to hide
from enemies very well.  They can also use the scout skill to see into a
nearby area.  A ranger can hasten, and thus be allowed to attack faster than
other classes.  Rangers are necessary for some of the quests, as tracking can
be required in some areas.  Parties without a ranger can become hopelessly
lost.  Because they have close ties to the druidic arts as well as combat
prowess, they can cast healing spells better than average.
