PIETY

        Dutifulnes, devotion, and concentration are the core of piety.  It
is the bastion of the holy, the strength of the devout.  The ability to
concentrate successfully assists in the recovery of magic, healing the
injured, and searching for all things not obvious.  It is the prime
requisite of clerics and paladins.
