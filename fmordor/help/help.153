HELP ON:
	*gamestat [r]

The gamestat command allows DM's to display or reload the current
game parameters.  These are stored in the mud.ini file, and may be
adjusted and reloaded as necessary, without shutting down the game.
*EXCEPTION*:  Do NOT change the port number, and then reload the
file.  You must shutdown the game using *shutdown if you wish to 
change the port number.
