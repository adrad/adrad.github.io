	PLEDGE

Syntax:

	PLEDGE [to] <monster>

	Pledge allows you to join the organization that the monster
belongs to.  When you join, you get many benefits.  You may kill players
who are members of opposing groups for experience, even if they are
lawful.  You will gain experience for killing if the other person is
pledged to the other group.  If you kill someone in your own group, you 
will both lose experience.  
	The amount of experience gained or lost is dependent on the level 
of the characters involved.
