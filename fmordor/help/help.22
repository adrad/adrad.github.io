Help on:
	PEEK <player/monster>

Peek allows thieves and assassins to try and "peek" at another player's
or monster's inventory.  If they are successful, they get to see what that 
creature is holding, and another die roll is made.  If they make the second
die roll, then no one will see that the thief or assassin tried to peek.

Example:

Mark says, "Hi".
: peek Mark
He is carrying: a bow, a knife.
