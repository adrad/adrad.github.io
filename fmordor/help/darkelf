	Dark elves, hating all and hated by all, are elves who have abandoned
their sylvan roots to dwell in the deepest of subterranean lairs.  Worshipping
the hideously cruel arachnid god, Lolth, their contempt for all life makes
them excellent assassins, often plying their trade more for enjoyment than
necessity.  Dark elves can see in the dark.
