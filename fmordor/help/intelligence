INTELLIGENCE

        Intelligence is the inate ability of a character to solve complex
problems in a timely manner.  One of the most important uses for intelligence
is in the casting of spells, which joins the comprehension of ancient,
intricate mystical scrawl and ability to remember and properly administer
enchanted spell components.  When these come together, the miracle known as
spell casting is born.  It is the prime requisite of mages and bards.
