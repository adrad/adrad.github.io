	Orcs are large, volatile demihumans, feared and respected as the
most war-proficient race.  Their strength and agility have earned them a
name as excellent fighters.  Their combat prowess is offset by their
lack of piety and their general difficulty with solving complex problems.
Orcs can also see in the dark.
