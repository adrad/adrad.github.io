ASSASSIN

	An assassin is one who lurks in shadows, waiting to backstab his or
her victim.  Assassins are noted for their ability to deal quick death; a
single attack being capable of doing incredible amounts of damage. The
assassin can hide better than most classes.  Part of their murderous training
involves learning to pick locks, which they can do almost as well as thieves.
Also, they have the ability to look ahead into new areas for victims with
the scout skill.
