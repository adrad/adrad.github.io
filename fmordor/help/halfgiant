	Half-giants are the results of an unusual couple, a giant and a
human.  The offspring of such a pair is typically both enormous in size
and in strength, towering over the common townsfolk.  While not as pious
or intelligent as some, their enormity makes them excellent warriors, having
little or no fear of combat.
