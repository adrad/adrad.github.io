	TRACK

Track is a special ability that rangers have.  If a ranger is successful,
he or she will discover the tracks of the last person to leave the room.
In other words, if a person had been in the room a day before and left
the room by heading north, the ranger would be able to discover this fact
with the track command.  This is extremely useful in getting out of
maze-like dungeons or forests.
