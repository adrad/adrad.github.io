The read command allows you to READ a scroll, thereby causing the spell
contained on the scroll to be cast.  READ is different from STUDY in that
the spell is actually cast when you read the scroll, but you do not learn
the spell.  It is different from CAST because no magic points are required
to read a scroll, and you do not have to know the spell to read it.

Example:

You have: a black scroll.
: read scroll on dog
You cast a hurt spell on the dog for 7 damage.
The black scroll disintegrates.
