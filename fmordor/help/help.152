Help on DM command:

	*talk [i|k|r|l|s|d]

  This function allows a DM or CT to create interactive talk files for
monsters online.
Arguments:  i = initialize.  Use this to start (or restart) a talk.
	    k = key.  Follow this argument with your key, and optional
		action.  Which should be in the form: ACTION <action>
		ex: *talk k pez ACTION drool
	    r = response. Follow this with a '+' or '-' and the talk response.   
		A '+' will append to the end of the response WITH NO EXTRA
		SPACES.  When using the '-' case, do not put a space
		between the '-' and your reponse.  When using the '+'
		case, the space is optional.  (Check it with *talk l)
	    l = list.  Lists the key and response stored so far.
	    s = save.  Saves the talk string to the monster specified.
		It may be necessary to *reload after saving.
	    d = delete.  Deletes the specified monster's tlak file 
		completely.  USE WITH CAUTION!
