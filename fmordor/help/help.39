The study command allows you to study magical scrolls and learn the spell
that is written upon it.  Most spells have to be learned this way.  Once
a scroll is studied, it disintegrates.

Example:

You have: a grey scroll, a black scroll.
: study scroll 2
You learn the hurt spell.
The black scroll disintegrates.
