MONK

	The monk is the master of self-discipline.  By calling upon inner
strength, the monk can do grave damage to foes.  A monk must spend his time
in self-contemplation, growing stronger all the time.  He can call upon his
constitution to heal himself by meditating.  The path of the monk is a hard
one, but those few warriors who chose it will be rewarded with powers beyond
most mortal men.  Due to the nature of the monk, they are not benefitted by
armor, but receive better armor class bonuses from high dexterity than other
classes.  Their hands must be free so they can use their special fighting
skills.  There are special weapons for monks, but they are indeed rare.
Because of their spiritual ties, they can cast healing spells better than
average.
