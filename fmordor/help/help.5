	TAKE <object> [#] [from] [<object> [#]]

Get and take allow you to pick up items that are on the floor of a room
or inside a container.  The container may be in your inventory or sitting
on the floor.  When you wish to get something from a container you must
provide the name of the item you want to take followed by the name of
the container.  Use the word "all" to specify that you wish to take
everything in the room or in a container.

Example:

On the floor you see a bag.
: get all from bag 2
You get a book, a pen, a pad of paper from a bag.
