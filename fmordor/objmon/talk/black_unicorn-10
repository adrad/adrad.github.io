hello
not to be rude, but you people really don't belong up here.
up
yes, up!  If you're not careful, you'll fall through the clouds.
fall
fall, as in fall back to where you came from.
nathan
Nathan is the lord of the unicorns.
lord
the unicorns glady follow whatever Nathan feels is best.
best
best for us.  You see, you humans are too brutal for us to communicate with individually.
communicate
well, we like to see what you people are doing every so often.
doing
watching you ruin the lands with your dirty cities.
where
you will have trouble finding Nathan up here without the emerald green key.
key
there is a green door to the north that the key opens, but you will have to find the key first.
find
I'm not sure where the key is to be found.  Ask the white unicorn about the key.
chanteclaire
ah, Miss Chanteclaire.  A beautiful person who visits often.  She is probably with Nathan.
mondrake
Mondrake is the cloud giant that lives up in the clouds, but I know not where he is.
