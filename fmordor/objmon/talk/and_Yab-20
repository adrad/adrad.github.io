ha!  Khallazar considers those gremlins to be a plague.  They were set loose on him by a powerful priestess who considers turning lead to gold as blasphemous
priestess
yes, a one time friend of my own, but now my mortal enemy.

we had a parting of the ways and she thought of me as an enemy.  Her name is Ghalara

She hid it where I dare not go

She hid it in a place I dare not go

a very nasty creature, but she guards my missing stone tablet

it is wise to stay away from there, but it is a place I need to send someone

I am too old to go there, but my stone tablet is in the hallway below the tomb

bring me the stone tablet, and I will trade you the key for it

when Khallazar discovered the method, he needed my help.  I showed him a spell which was carved on a stone tablet.  Ghalara never forgave me for that

hallway
there is a very short hallway between the tomb and the werewolve's lair in the cellar

you know of the werewolves, I am sure.  Just most people do not know of the bitch under the floor

I would ask you to return my tablet, stolen by Gharlara
