bridge
this bridge was built by Khallazar the great alchemist.  He lives down the road on the other side.
khallazar
he turns lead to gold.  I have no idea why he wants to bother charging people to cross his bridge, but he has hired me to collect the fees.
gold
did you bring some lead?  Khallazar will turn it to gold before your very eyes!  But watch those damned gremlins.
lead
confusing, isn't it?  Now lead has become almost as valuable as gold, thanks to Khallazar.
gremlins
yeah, they seem to infest Khallazar's hut, constantly chewing up his gold.  He can't get rid of them.
hut
over the bridge and down the road, till you see the path going east.  It's strange enough that you will recognize it.  heh.
