surly you know where the lair is located?

somewhere in this building you will find a portal to another place.  My lair.

the portal will take you to another time and place, but you will be able to return, after you have spoken again to me.

all knowledge is a quest, is it not?

to start your quest, you must find me in my lair.

a place out of time.  the portal is within these walls of the Towers.
time
I grow weary speaking to you of this.  Speak to me in my lair.

these Towers hold far more than meets the eye.  You will have to search carefully.
search
no, not here.  Elsewhere in the Towers.
