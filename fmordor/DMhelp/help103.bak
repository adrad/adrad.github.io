Help on:

	*RELOAD

	This function will reload the parent room from disk.  This is 
necessary when editing has been done off line and you wish to implement 
changes made.  If editing is done off line and the room is not reloaded 
into memory, there is a chance that the off line edits will not take 
effect. 

example:
:*reload
Ok.
