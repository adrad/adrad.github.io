Muddle --  A MUD client for Mordor (and other) MUDs.

Here is some quick documentation:

Copy sample.muddle to a file called .muddle in your root directory.
Edit as appropriate.

At the muddle> prompt, hit ? for a list of commands and functions.

Once in the game, any of these commands can be achieved by typing
the command with a # in front of it.   So typing #l will list all
open connections.

Once you're connected, you can send commands to any connection you
have open at the time by typing #, the connection number, and the
command.  For example: #2 kill dog

To make another connection the active connection (i.e. the one that
displays to your screen), type a # followed by the connection number
and hit return.  Example: #3

To do a macro listed in your .muddle file, just type the key word.
