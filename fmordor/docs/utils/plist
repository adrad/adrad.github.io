PLIST COMMAND:

    The plist commands provides a simply way to list a given player's
class, level, password, and inventory without having to use the editor
or actually log the player in.  

syntax: 
    plist [[-inp] [-l #]] <players>

    -n    The '-n' tells plist to only list the name of the player.
          The '-n' flag is intented to be used with the '-l #' 
          flag to allow the output list of players to be piped
          or redirected into another command.

    -i    The '-i' flag requires plist to list all the objects in the
          player inventory, including items in containers.  The
          output format is a bit rough, so some line wrap around
          may occur.  NOTE:  It is not wise to type "plist -i *" in
          the player directory due to the massive amount of data
          that would be produced.

    -p    The '-p' requires plist to display the player password.

    -l #  The '-l #' requires plist to list all players equal to the 
          given level #.


Examples:
    plist -p Foo Bar
      -- this will list the class, level, race and password for 
         Foo and Bar.

    plist -l 1 Player1 ... Player10
      -- this will list all the players that are level 1 in the list
         of players Player1 to Player10.

    plist -i Fubar
      --this will list the class, race, level  and inventory
        for the player Fubar.
