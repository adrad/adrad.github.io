	These are guidelines for the creation of custom equipment.
You should also read the Book of Custom equipment.

	Generic versions of most items can be purchased from this room. 
You can then use the [*oname] and [*set o] commands to customize them
easily for each person. 

--- General Guidelines ---

1. The maximum damage a custom weapon should do is 3d4+4.
2. The maximum number of shots any item should be given is 150.
3. The maximum armor an item of armor should have is 10.
4. The maximum number of shots a magic item should be given is 5.

	These guidelines are to insure a balanced scenario, and to insure
that the weapons monsters carry will still be in demand.  The cost for a
custom item should be at least its initial value plus an amount that
reflects the additions you make to it.  A general rule of thumb is to
charge the base price +$25,000 gp per minute it takes you to modify the
item.  Remember, you can never charge too much.
