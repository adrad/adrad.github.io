	***********************************************

			    NOTICE
	Although these storage rooms have proven to
	be safe and effective in storing extra items
	you may not wish to carry around with you,
	there have been rare times when thieves have
	managed to hide and enter these storage rooms
	unknown to the person who owns it.
	If that happens to you, and something is 
	missing the next time you visit your storage,
	don't even bother to complain.  I will not be 
	responsible for what happens.
	You purchase these rooms with that risk in mind.
