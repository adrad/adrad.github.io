history
yes, I have heard Jactac speak of an old king who died, but had three heirs.
king
there was once a king who reigned from the Lyanden castle.
castle
which one?  You surly know there are three.  The two sons, Prince Ragnar and Prince Rutger built castles outside the city.
lyanden
a dark place since the king died.  The gold and azure towers inhabited mostly by ghosts.  But Runella lives today in the crimson tower.
crimson
Princess Runella is there.  She sends her minions out to foment trouble between her brothers, hoping they kill each other and she can rule alone.
gold
the gold tower was built to honor Prince Ragnar.  Some say he still maintains an apartment there.
azure
the king wanted a tower to honor Prince Rutger, so he built the azure tower.  It has many secret passages in it.
ragnar
Jactac the raven can tell you more.  ask him.  He lives just above your head.
rutger
you should talk to Jactac the raven, who lives in one of the houses above.
runella
speak to Jactac the raven.  I believe he is home now, and he lives in the trees above.
