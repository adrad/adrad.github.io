the wizard who lives in the tree, yes.  He provides magical items to the elves.

didn't you know?  They have a workshop on the east side of the enchanted forest.
workshop
yes, the elves make jewelry from the tears of the sleepless dragon.
dragon
the Sleepless Dragon guards the golden apple tree in the garden of Queen Hera.
hera
shhh.. speak softly when you say her name.  She is jealous of her golden apples.
apples
some say they have great magical powers.  But I know not, having never tasted one.
garden
the garden?  You can find the garden through a hollow log laying on the ground.
log
the hollow log is hidden on the other side of the bridge.  But you can find it if you search for it.
tears
they are amber drops which make beautiful jewelry.  The elves use them.
high
the High Invoker?  Or high in the tree?  Nevermind...  The High Invoker lives high enough to overlook the Sleepless Dragon.  They broodingly watch each other.
