lost
This is the enchanted forest, and many strange things happen here.
strange
Yes, Xandaus can tell you of them.
hermit
The hermit?  He lives in a cave not far from here.  His name is Xandaus.
xandaus
He is a smart old guy, but kind of a loner.  He lives in a cave.
cave
The cave is across a rope bridge.  Be careful going across it.
bridge
The bridge is perilous, because harpies and griffons like to attack there.
griffon
A strange beast, half eagle and half lion.  Its feather is quite valuable.
harpies
They attack you on the rope bridge going to the cave of Xandaus.
dragons
I know not of dragons, but talk to Xandaus.  He has seen them. 
enchanted
Yes, a forest where dragons, elves and fairie folk dwell.  All friends of Xandaus.
elves
The elven workshop?  It is on the other side of the woods.  Clever little people.
