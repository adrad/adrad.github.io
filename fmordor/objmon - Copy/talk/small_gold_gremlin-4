gold
it tastes pretty good, but I think mages have other uses for it
fault
yes, your fault.  Khallazar tries to save the very best for mages
mages
Khallazar is very friendly with the wizards at the Wizard's Eye.
eye
you mean the place where mages train?
wizards
yes, the Wizard's Eye.  that big building where the mages train.
wizard
do you refer to Trantori, the High Invoker, or do you mean the Wizard's Eye?
trantori
He enchants the jewelry for the elven chief jeweler.  He has a wand just for the purpose, I think, or is it a big blue ball?  I forget
train
oh ho!  Then the three wizards sent you.  They want you to bring back an ingot, piece of very pure gold, the kind Khallazar puts in reserve.
ingot
well, since the wizards sent you, I will tell you the ingot is hidden somewhere in this room, guarded by a tiny little mouse, but who looks very, very ferocious.  Don't be afraid of him, no matter how terrible he appears
hidden
you must search for it, I'm afraid, but its easily found by someone of your talents
mouse
the little mouse has been enchanted to appear as a three-headed snake.  You can take him with one quick slap.
