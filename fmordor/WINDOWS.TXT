Mordor 6.x Installation Notes for Microsoft Operating System Users
==================================================================

 NOTE:
*** This program does not work with 95/BOB/98/NT/2000/ME/XP ***

  If you don't know what a compiler is, have never compiled a program, and
don't want to learn, give up now.  Mordor will run on Microsoft operating
systems, but does not come set up to do so by default.  You will need to
compile a binary for your particular system if you really want to run
Mordor on your Gates-box.

  You can get a compiler at:

	http://www.cygwin.com/

  Alternatively, you can set up Linux or FreeBSD on your machine and not 
only run mordor, but greatly improve your system's security, relability, 
and performance.

  WOOT!!
