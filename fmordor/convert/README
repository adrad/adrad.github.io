NOTE: Before you can use this, you _must_ copy the libs from your original 
structures (the ones you are converting from) into ./lib
Something like "cp ~/src/lib/* ./lib"  might work.  
You also need to edit convert.c so the first three #includes point to 
your original (converting from) header files.  Do this now if you want to 
use this program!  Ok, thanks.


This program will (hopefully) convert binary mordor files between 
struct versions.  You should first edit convert.h and apply any 
necessary changes to the structures contained there.  These represent 
the structures that will be written to the new files.  The old 
structures are read from ../include/mordb.h, but you can of course 
change that too (in convert.c).  If you want some default values assigned to 
the new areas in your structures, either do it here in convert.c or from 
within Mordor itself (most likely in init_ply).

It will read either a player, monster, object or room file as specified
on the command line and write out a new version.  The file names do get
changed long the way so that your originals dont get overwritten.  File
names change as follows:
players:  plyname ->  plyname.new
objects:  o##  ->  new.o##
monsters: m##  ->  new.m##
rooms:    r##### -> r#####.new

Paths for the files come from your mordor.cf

This program is neither fully tested, nor guaranteed to work.  YMMV.
