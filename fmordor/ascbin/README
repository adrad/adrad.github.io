  This is an old (but updated JPF) (by Mordor standards) and very useful
  utility.  This allows you to convert your database from binary form into
  ASCII files.  This will let you to convert from databases created using one
  struct to another.  It can also be used to port databases to other
  architectures.

  It operates in 2 modes:

Binary to Ascii:
  Most of the datafiles in Mordor are binary format.  You can convert 
them to ascii with --

        ab b -[r|p|c|o|a] 

-r will convert all the room files using a file called rooms.txt
-p will convert all the player files using a file called players.txt
-c will convert all the creature files using a file called creatures.txt
-o will convert all the object files using a file called objects.txt
-a will convert al four of the above options, in effect convertig the
entire database

  This this will convert the binary room, player, creature, or object 
files to ASCII files.  Thees files can then be turned back to binary with --

        ab a -[r|p|c|o|a]

The same file names are used in reverse process.

NOTES:

Make sure you have the mordor.cf file (or whatever the current configuration
file for Mordor is called) in the current directory or in ../bin.  This
file determines the paths for the files to be read from to written to.
