Help on:
	STEAL <object> [from] <player/monster> [#]

Thieves and assassins may steal objects from monsters or other players.
If they are successful, the victim will not even know he or she was stolen
from.  However, if unsuccessful, the victim is warned.  Monsters usually
get quite angry when someone tries to steal from them.

WARNING:  Stealing from other players should not be abused.  It's been
	rumored that players caught using this command abusively have
	lost the power to steal.
