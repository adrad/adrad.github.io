DEXTERITY

        Speed and agility are the core of dexterity.  It determines one's
ability to dodge hits, pick locks, hide, flee from a battle gone awry, i.e.
in general it helps one stay out of harms way.  It also assists those
classes gifted with the ability of circling to keep ahead of their foes more
effectively.  Dexterity is the prime requisite of assassins, thieves, druids,
and rangers.
