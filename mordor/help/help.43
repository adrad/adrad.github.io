	SELL <object> [#]

You may only sell things you have in a pawn shoppe.  There is one pawn shoppe
in the game, and it is hidden.  Take a careful look at room descriptions to
find clues on how to get there.  And remember to use the SEARCH command.
Once you find the pawn shoppe, you may sell any item you have that is
not broken or too cheap.  The pawn shoppekeeper will not give you more
than 10000 gold pieces for any one item, so if it is actually worth more,
then you'll just have to settle for less.  To find out how much money the
pawn shoppekeeper will give you an item before you actually sell it, use
the VALUE command.
