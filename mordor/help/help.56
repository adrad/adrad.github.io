	TALK <monster> [#] [<keyword>]

Talk allows you to communicate with certain monsters.  Some monsters
can even carry on interactive conversations.  If you supply a keyword,
the monster may be able to give you some more information about it.

Example:

: talk scribe
The scribe says to you, "<Yawn> You bore me.".
: talk scribe bore
The scribe says to you, "Yes, you are a boring fellow.  I see no reason
   to continue a rational discussion with you."
