Help on:
	BRIBE <monster> $<amount>

Bribe allows you to offer monsters money in the hope that they will leave
the room, not bothering you anymore.  This is useful if you want a monster
to stop guarding a treasure you'd like to take or if you're really getting
womped in the middle of combat.  The higher the level, the more money the
monster will want.

Example:

: bribe criminal $200
The criminal takes your money, but stays.
