	Large, strong, ugly and stupid, trolls enjoy to hoard treasure, kill
for pleasure and eat raw flesh.  Trolls generally prefer to travel alone, but
can sometimes be found in groups of three or more.  Their life of feasting
on whatever putrescent sustenance crosses their path gives them amazing
constitution, but they lack wits and piety.  Able to see in complete darkness,
they have little reason other than hunger to venture out into the light.
