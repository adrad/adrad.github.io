	One of the eldest races, elves have accumulated a vast collection of
arcane knowledge over their vast cultural tenure.  Slightly smaller than
humans, with a hint of frailty, they rely on their wits to survive and
prosper.  Elves have a close kindship with the woods, and their ability to
see in the dark blends well with their love of deep forests.
