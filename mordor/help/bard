BARD

	The bard is a very clever and resourceful character class.  Bards can
be expected to spend their lives in search of knowledge of the arts and
sciences.  The young bard is usually quite foolish.  The more scholarly bards
can entertain an entire room with a song which will envigorate all.  Also,
bards have been known to charm friends and foes so completely that they are
beyond harm.  Bards also have a limited ability to read a person's aura and
get a glimpse of their future. This skill is not inherent, and requires the
memorization of the spell or acquisition of the proper components.  Bards
also have above average ability to cast healing spells.

Skills:
Charm, fortune, sing.

Their stat cycle is as follows (starts over at levels 12 and 22):
