Help on command:

	touch

  This skill allows experienced Monks to inflict great damage on their
enemies.  The damage will usually be half the hit points of the enemy
but a powerful Monk may sometimes completely destroy an enemy.  Touch 
of Death does not work on undead creatures.

example:

:touch hippie
