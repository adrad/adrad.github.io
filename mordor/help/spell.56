Syntax:

	CAST CONJURE <creature>

Cost: variable

  This spell conjures a spirit, alchemical, or mythological creature
that will fight the target.  Conjure may only be cast by mage-type 
classes who have learned the spell, or have obtained an item that 
casts the spell.  There is always a chance that the conjured
creature will be aggressive or attack the conjurer for summoning it.

Example:
: c conjure Kralle
You summon a foul shade.
The foul shade attacks Kralle.

Conjure may be used by Chaotics to player kill.  It cannot be cast
on lawful characters.  Death to conjured creatures results in experience
and profficiency loss.
