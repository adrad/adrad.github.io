	HASTE

Haste is a special ability given exclusively to rangers.  It increases
their dexterity temporarily by 5 points, and allows them to attack
monsters faster with lower armor class.  Haste may only be used by
rangers once every 10 minutes, and it only lasts for 2 minutes.  But
it is a very useful ability.
