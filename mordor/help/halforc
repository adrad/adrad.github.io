	The product of an orc and human couple, these large, powerful
demihumans are generally viewed with suspicion by either of their descendant
races.  Their orcish heritage often leads them to be fierce combatants,
shunning the mystic arts for the thrill of hand-to-hand combat.  They are
slightly less pious than average, concentrating more on melee.
