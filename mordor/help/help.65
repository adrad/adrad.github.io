	PRAY

Pray is a skill given to clerics and paladins which will allow them
every 10 minutes or so to pray to their god(s) for additional piety. 
If granted, the player will have extra piety for about 5 minutes or
so.  This means that the player will heal faster and be attacked less
by monsters during that time.
