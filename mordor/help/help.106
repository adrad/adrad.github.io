Help on DM Command:

	*perm [o|c] [name|d] [timeout|slot]

  This command allows DMs to make a monster or an item permanent in the
parent room.  You may also use this command to delete objects or creatures
from the perm list for a room, as well as set the timeout value.  
The timeout value is the time in seconds that it will take before the permed
object or creature will return after leaving the room. 

examples

:*perm o leather 1300
leather armor permed with timeout of 1300.  
:*perm c wiz 19900
wizard's apprentice permed with timeout of 19900.
