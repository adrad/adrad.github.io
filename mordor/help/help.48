	REPAIR <object> [#]

The repair command only works in repair shoppes and will allow you to
repair an object that has been broken.  To find out how much the repair
will cost, use the COST command first.  Once an item is repaired, it
is as good as new.  But watch out, sometimes the repair smith completely
shatters the object you're trying to repair.  He's not as good a smithy
as he once was.
