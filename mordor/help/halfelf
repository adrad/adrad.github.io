	Half-elves are the product of a human and elven couple, and while not
embraced by either culture, they are generally liked by all.  Though smaller
than humans, their elven lineage makes them of above average intelligence.
Their multi-cultural heritage makes them diversely skilled in both melee and
arcana, and are typically welcomed into any adventuring party.
