Help on:
	BASH <monster/player> [#]

This command allows fighters and barbarians to bash an opponent, knocking
it to the floor for several seconds.  Bash does half the normal damage of
a regular attack, but it also causes the opponent to be delayed for
several seconds while he tries to get up off the floor.  This in effect
gives the player the initiative.
