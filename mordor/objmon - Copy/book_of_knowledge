*************************************************************


	Set forth upon these pages is a brief account of the 
knowledge that all wise adventurers should carry with them as 
they venture forth into the realms.  Your quest begins at the 
Tree of Life.  From the tree your path can go many 
directions, to limbo for the foolish and to vast wealth and 
treasures for those who are well prepared and knowledgeable 
from the beginning.  You will begin at level one, and your 
goal is to rise in level and status, until you have traveled 
the farthest reaches, gained the highest treasures, and 
defeated the most powerful of monsters.  Very few will reach 
this height, so good luck to you.  Here is some information 
you should know and use about the city of Oceancrest, and the classes 
and races within.

The classes:

Assassin
	An assassin is one who lurks in shadows, waiting to 
backstab his or her victim.  Assassins are noted for their 
ability to deal quick death; a single attack being capable of 
doing incredible amounts of damage.  The assassin can hide 
better than most classes. 
	Skills:
		Steal
		Backstab
		Peek
	Prime Requisites:
		Dexterity
		Strength
	Suggested Races:
		Hobbit
		Human
		Dwarf

Barbarian
	Raised in the harsh lands of tribal villages, barbarians 
are hearty warriors capable of sustaining blow after blow from opponents.  
The barbarian can bash its opponent, rendering them stunned for a while 
and unable to attack. The barbarian can circle an opponent, an excellent 
tactic used while fighting. 
	Skills:
		Bash
		Circle
	Prime Requisites:
		Strength
		Constitution
		Dexterity
	Suggested Races:
		Half-Giant
		Human
		Dwarf
		Orc
Cleric
	The cleric is the most powerful of the classes in the 
arts of healing.  In addition to the ability to heal, the 
cleric can turn the undead.  Clerics can also achieve magical 
powers only bested by a mage.
	Skills:
		Turn
		Pray
	Prime Requisites:
		Piety
	Suggested Races:
		Human
		Half-Elf
		Gnome

Fighter
	The fighter is a master of the fighting arts.  As the fighter
advances he will achieve great proficiency in the use of weapons.
iThe fighter is able to bash and circle opponents like a barbarian.
	Skills:
		Bash
		Circle
	Prime Requisites:
		Strength
		Dexterity
	Suggested Races:
		Human
		Half-Giant
		Dwarf
		Orc

Mage
	A master of the magic arts, the mage will gain the power to 
unleash incredible amounts of damage by means of spells, but magic 
alone cannot overcome all enemies.  A mage can teach low level spells 
to other players, once the mage has learned them.
	Skills:
		Teach
	Prime Requisites:
		Intelligence
	Suggested Races:
		Human
		Elf
		Half-Elf

Paladin
	The paladin is a brave warrior of faith, and must continue to 
be good aligned in order to inflict damage.  An evil paladin suffers greatly.  
The paladin is a powerful warrior and healer, and like clerics, can turn the 
undead.  A paladin suffers a small loss if he flees from a fight.
	Skills:
		Turn
		Pray
	Prime Requisites:
		Strength
		Piety
	Suggested Races:
		Human
		Dwarf
		Gnome
		Orc

Ranger
	The ranger is a skillful fighter with the abilities to 
track opponents, to search for hidden exits, monsters, and 
treasures, and to hide from enemies very well.  A ranger can 
hasten, and thus be allowed to attack faster than other 
classes.  Rangers are necessary for some of the quests, as 
tracking can be required in some areas. Parties without a 
ranger can become hopelessly lost.
	Skills:
		Track
		Haste
	Prime Requisites:
		Dexterity
	Suggested Races:
		Human
		Hobbit
 
Thief
	A thief is a very valuable player in any group of 
adventurers, and in some cases, necessary.  A thief is 
capable of picking locks and stealing from opponents, and
has the ability to sneak undetected from place to place.
Like the assassin, a thief can backstab.
	Skills:
		Steal
		Pick
		Peek
		Backstab
	Prime Requisites:
		Dexterity
	Suggested Races:
		Human
		Hobbit

These suggestions are of course only guidelines, since a player
of iany race can become any class.  Oceancrest has seen many a 
powerful Hobbitish Barbarian, Half-Giant Cleric, or Elven 
Ranger.  Be wise to the fact that all classes have their 
strengths and weaknesses, and that a group of warriors will 
get no further than a group of mages, since cooperation between 
classes is vital to success.

A note on chaos:
	Those who choose to be chaotic be forewarned:  you will 
be able to attack and steal from other players, but also can be 
attacked and stolen from.  From time to time, a powerful 
chaotic character may decide to wreak havoc upon anyone of a lower 
level, and thus vulnerable to him or her.  Remember then, that if you 
chose to be chaotic, you must accept both its benefits and its 
penalties.  
The Dungeonmasters, being the kind and sensitive people
they are, will allow you to change from chaotic to lawful once in your
life, if you have seen the light and wish to mend your sinful ways.
A lawful player may never become chaotic.

Where to begin:
	There are several areas designed for beginning 
adventurers, look for these in the areas surrounding the Tree 
of Life.  You will find plenty of areas to get you started.
You should also read the Guide to Oceancrest, and ask Styx to
send you a map of Oceancrest.

A note on quests and quest items:
	Once you have attained your third title, you may want to 
begin looking for quest items and begin completing the quests. 
To get a start at this, talk to Vlassen the Wise, or to Aetolos, 
in the Red Eye Pub.
