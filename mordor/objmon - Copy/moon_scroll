Knowledge of the Phases of the Moon may be useful in your quest.

combined, they will solve a much larger problem.  Your quest begins
in the sewers of Kista.  Get the key to the sewers from the 
Adamantine Dragon.  Lord Aaileman will tell you how to find the
dragon.  The key to his chamber is made by elves of the finest
wood.  Note that you may not get this key again.  Guard it with
your life. 
 
It is signed "Elise" and sealed with the seal of the Order of the 
White Moon, the great wizard's society in Kista.
