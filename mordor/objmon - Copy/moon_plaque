You see a large brass plaque with two glowing spheres on it.  There's some
writing above the spheres, but it's pretty illegible.  The pictures on
the plaque make more sense than the writing does.  

On the left is the red sphere.  It is designated on the plaque with a
hollow circle.  On the right is a blue sphere.  It is designated with a
filled-in circle.  

Looking carefully in the room, you can barely make out a couple of hidden
portals that may lead you somewhere you don't expect.
