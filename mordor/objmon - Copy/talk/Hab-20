I am Hab, and you may advance to level ten through my door
eleven
to advance to that level, you must go through Nab's door
twelve
ah, the final level for the amethest group.  You must enter Yab's door
khallazar
I need a tiny bit of the purest gold from him.  Return the ingot to me and I will trade you a key to the training room for it
ingot
yes, the ingot.  The small gremlin at Khallazar's owes me a favor.  Ask him
gold
its in ingot form at Khallazar's
key
I will give you the training key in exchange for an ingot of gold.  Be careful with the key, as it can only be used three times.  You must use it twice to reach level ten, and you will need it once to reach level eleven.  Talk to Nab
three
yes, I said three times.  Do not lose it as you will need it once more to advance to level eleven
gremlin
the small gremlin is a loveable but aggressive little tike.   You need to talk to him.  Probably it would be best if you were invisible while you engaged him
training
the training key?
door
if you aspire to level ten, enter my door after you obtain the ingot at Khallazar's
