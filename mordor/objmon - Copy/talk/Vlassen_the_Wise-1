Good day to you, friend.  Welcome to Mordor.
hi
Good day to you, friend.  Welcome to Mordor.
mordor
This land is an anomoly in cyberspace, forever caught in an eddy of time.
death
Death is strangely not permanent here, being simply part of the total cycle. 
life
Life is simply the end of death, and nothing to be feared.  It is transitory.
quest
This land is full of quests.  You must talk to some of the permanent residents.
residents
Yes.  Start with Aetelos in the northern part of the city.
aetelos
He is often found at the Red Eye Pub.  Go and find him.
red
That pub is in the northern section of the city.
scrolls
Scrolls are very useful in this plane.  A great mage made them available.  
magic
Ah, scrolls.  Yes, in this part of the universe there is magic. 
mage
To learn of the great mages, you must first seek Aetelos, the bard. 
dragons
Some are good.  You will find the metallic ones to be non-aggressive.
cycle
In the Land of Mordor, life follows death in an endless cycle.  Do you seek a quest?
yes
Then find and speak to Aetelos the bard.
time
Time has not much meaning in the cycle from death to life.
