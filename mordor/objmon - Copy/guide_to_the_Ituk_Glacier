The Ituk Glacier is a massive chunk of ice located in the polar 
regions of the northernmost continent.  The Glacier is not reachable
via "regular" means, and you must use powerful magic to get there. 

To find out how to get to the Glacier, talk to Aetoles at the Red-Eye
Pub off of Hofton Avenue.  He will set you off on a quest of massive
proportions, which will eventually take you through the Glacier.  Be
warned that the Glacier is a very dangerous place.  There is no place
to run in the endless tundra and ice.  Frost Giants viciously patrol 
and guard their sacred lands.  Massive yeti come down from the mountains
searching for whatever food they can find in the sub-zero temperatures.
Finally, the great white dragons of Ituk have been known to swoop down
on unsuspecting prey, freezing them instantly with their powerful magic.
It is not a place for the beginners.

Before you enter the Glacier, be aware that the entire scenario is set
up for a party of adventurers of level seven or higher.  You should have
at least four people in your party.  You will also encounter monsters
which attack in packs.  You should strive to take out the monsters at
once (each member of the party taking one monster), not taking them out
one at a time.  This will inevitablly kill the person with the lowest
piety.  You should also have in your party, a ranger to track through
the Glacier, a thief/assassin to pick locks and traps, and a cleric/mage
to provide magical/healing support to the party.  Of course no party
would be complete without a barbarian or fighter.  You should limit your
parties to no more than six people, or you won't end up with much 
treasure, individually.

Good Luck!
