  Plist: Player lister for Mordor MUDs (http://mordor.nazgul.com).
 Works much like list does for monsters, rooms, and objects.

  Plist is used to examine player files associated with Mordor MUDS.
Options to date are:

plist [[-pni] [-l #] [-s #]] <players>

-p  Include password in output
-n  Name only....good for piping to other stuff for actions on player files
-i  Show inventory

-l  Sort by level
-s  Sory by spell number

<players> is optional.  Default is all players.
