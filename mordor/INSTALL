d) restart mordord
e) log in as a DM

Step 2: Details
Creating a DM character -
  You can now create a new character, and make them a DM.  Just
go through the character creation process, and then add the 
name of your new character to the mordor.cf file under one
of the DMNAME= sections.  You will then need to restart mordord
and log in again.  Once you have completed this, you can reload
the mordor configuration (mordor.cf) without restarting by using
the DM command *game.
