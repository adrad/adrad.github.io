	*NOTEPAD [d|a]

	This allows you to read, append, and delete the DM notepad.  If 
used without a flag, it will print out the notepad.  The d flag will 
clear the notepad.  The a flag will invoke an editor for appending to the 
notepad.  To exit the editor, put a period (.) on a line by itself.

example:
:*notepad
            === DM Notepad ===
