DATABASE:
  You are encouraged to create your own scenarios, with or without
the portions provided.
  The editor provides an easy way to create your world.  Just read the
documentaion provided in the help and docs directories, and you will be on
your way.
  
  When you first start up the game you will want to log in and
create the DM characters (telnet localhost 4040).  There are a limited
number of DMs and those have been defined at compilation.  You can change 
the DM names by editing the bin/mordor.cf file and using the *game command
to reload your changes.
  You may create as many caretakers as you wish by setting their class to
12.  The DM names are set in the bin/mordor.cf file and default to the
following: 

	Tesseract
	Erech
	Azog
	Garth
	Alice
	Oligarchy
	Gandalf

  These are the only characters that will have FULL access to the DM
commands.  Caretakers can access around 70% of all DM commands. 
  If you are planning on running Mordor on a long-term basis, please

updates and bug patches.
