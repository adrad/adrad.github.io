MS-Windows notes
=================

  All the binaries in bin/ are for the Linux platform.  No binaries are 
provided for any Microsoft platform.  Mordor will run on M$, but you will 
need to compile it.  This can be done using cygwin32 or another M$ C 
complier.


Playing with the Mordor Source Code
===================================
If you wish to play with the source yourself, a project file for
Microsoft's Visual C++ (Win32/NT) is also included. You can find it in
~/src.

        Have fun!
