mordord -- This is the game itself.  The version given has been
compiled under Linux 2.4.14.  If you have another OS, you will need
to compile it yourself.  Look in the src/ directory for more
information. 
	You can call mordord from a shell program if you like, or just
from the command line.  It accepts flags, with the two most important
being the port and the reuse command.  To run the game on a port other
than the default (4040) you can start it with: mordor <port#>.
	If you are having trouble with it running try: 

			mordor -r &  

	This will tell it to reuse the ports
The most common problem is that this distribution is installed
in the improper place and not configured properly.  Please make sure that 
the uid that the mordord process is running under owns all files 
associated with this package.  It is not necessary nor recommended that 
you run mordord as root.
  
mordord *MUST* be installed in the paths defined in mtype.h (default is
/home/mordor).  If you wish to run it under another directory, you will
need to change the paths in bin/mordor.cf.
