PSEARCH COMMAND:

   The psearch command searchs all the characters in the mordor/player
directory for a specified item.  Psearch will search a characters entire 
inventory including the contents of containers.  Psearch will list a player's
name, the total number of specified object in the player's possession,
and the number of the specified objects that are in containers.
Psearch also has the option to list any weapon that does more than
a specified amount of damage, or armor that exceeds a given armor
rating.

syntax:
    psearch <[object #] [-adnsv #] [-N <name>]> [-P <players>]


    If the first argument for psearch is a number, then psearch 
will search for the object corresponding to that number.  The item
number does not have to be given if any of the other flags are set.
The flags may appear in any order.


    -a #   The '-a' will list all objects on players that have
           an armor rating equal or greater to '#'.

    -d #   The '-d' will list all objects on players that do
           a maxium damage equal or greater than '#'.  This is
           based on ndice*sdice + pdice.

    -n #   The '-n' flag specifies the object number to search for.
           This flag is redundant if the object number has already 
           been specified as the first argument of psearch.

    -s #   The '-s' will list all players that know the spell 
           which corresponds to '#'. The first spell starts at 0.

    -v #   The '-v' will list all objects on players with value
           exceeding '#'.

    -N <name> Requires psearch to use the name following the -N as
           the name of the object to search for.  The given name
           has to perfectly match the object name in ordor for the object
           to be listed.  In cases where the object name is more than
           one word or contains single quotes, the entire name needs
           to be double quoted.   i.e. psearch -N "dragon's blade"

   -P <players> Normally psearch will search all the players in
           the mordor/player/ directory. The '-P' flag requires psearch
           to only search the following list of players.  Note:  the
           list of players still must exist in mordor/player/. The '-P'
           allows a way to limit psearch's search domain.

Examples:
    psearch 212
     --this will list all the players that have object 212 
       (assassin daggers)

    psearch -d 20
     --this will search and list all the players and objects that
       can do 20+ damage. 

    psearch -N "small knife" -P P1 P2 P3
     -- this will search all the given players (P1, P2, P3) that
        have objects with the name of small knife. 


Errors:
     If a player cannot be loaded, the user will be notifed of a
     player load error.or.
