  The Mordor Database Editor can be used to edit or 
create players, creatures objects, and rooms for the Mordor MUD server.
It is menu driven and easy to use.
  If you are using MS-Windows you will need to install the ansi.sys
driver to use the editor.  This is usually done with a line similar
to the one below added to your autoexec.bat:

device=C:/windows/command/ansi.sys
