GSTAT COMMAND:

The gstat command produces various statistical information about all
the characters in mordor.  In addition, gstat can list all the 
mordor characters that exceed a given amount of gold, play time,
or level.

Syntax:
        gstat [-glts #] [-d] [-P <players ...>]

The flags can appear in any order except for the '-P' which must be 
the last flag in the command arguement list.  Also each flag must 
appear separately.   i.e. -gl 10 needs to be -g 10 -l 10
Also, due to the amount of data output, the static breakdown will not be
listed if the -d, -g, -l or -t flags are used.

    -d    The '-d' flag will list all the players that are either
          a DM, a caretaker or None.

    -g #  The '-g' flag will list all players with '#' or more
          gold.

    -l #  The '-l' flag will list all players that are '#'+
          level. 

          breakdown on players '#'+ level.  This is intended to allow
          for a more accurate statical breakdown.  Often times
          players create a 'one time' character which can skew
          the true static brekadown of the game..

    -t #  The '-t flag will list all players that have a play
          time greater than '#' seconds..

    -P <players...> The '-P' tells gstat to run gstat only on the 
          player's names specified after the '-P'.  If the '-P
          is not present, gstat will use all the characters in
          the players directory.  Note: the player's names following
          '-P' still must be in the player/ directory. The '-P'
          was intended as a means to limit gstat static domain.

Examples:
      gstat -l 10
         -- list all the players that are 10+ level.

      gstat -d -P P1 P2 P3
         -- list all the DMs in the player list P1, P2, P3

      gstat -s 2
         -- only preform the statical breakdown on players that
            are 2nd or higher level.el.

Other notes:

Class / Level Breakdown:
    The number following the Class number tells the total 
    number of players of that class.  The two lines of numbers
    represents the number of players of the given class at
    at each level.  The first line of numbers corresponds to 
    1st to 13th level , the second line of numbers corresponds to
    14th to 26th level, where 26 slot is for all players that are
    26+ level..

    Due to the amount of output from gstat, and the length of time to
    search all the players, it might be easier to redirect gstat 
    output to a file: gstat > gstat_file.
