hello
good day to you, can I help you?
key
yes, I have a key, it doesn't break as easily as the one we sell
eldritch
one of the greatest warriors in the land once, he is buried in a great tomb on the eastern path
zelinx
Zelinx was a strange fellow, came to me in his old age and asked to be buried with his tower
tower
it is quite a spectacle, but I can't get in anymore, there are guardians watching the entrance
spectacle
I often wonder what it is they are guarding, Zelinx was a powerful illusionist
illusionist
like a wizard, very powerful in the art of illusion
guarding
I heard once from a passing by adventurer, that Zelinx prepared for death by insuring that he would remain as long as the tower did
insuring
his tower is extremely well foritfied, he buried it in the ground!
fortified
all I can say is that the tower is surrounded by powerful magic, whether Zelinx lives or not
lives
I have heard that really powerful users of the art are able to continue life after death, living on the power of their magic
magic
there must be many magical artifacts buried in that tower, but, alas no one is crazy enough to try to pass the guardians
tomb
Eldritch's Tomb was built by his friends and he was buried
