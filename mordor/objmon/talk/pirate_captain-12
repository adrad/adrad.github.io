You should spend more time on a pirate ship.

You wouldn't believe how much a unicorn's horn sells for in town!

That's beyond me.  I just sell them to whoever gives me the most gold!
gold
Gold's what makes the world go around!
mages
The mages say the horns have wierd magical powers.  Something about being able to heal just about anything.

I got the key, but I ain't giving it away for nothing.  Got a treasure map on ya?
trade
OK...we'll trade.  Get a pirate's key from one of my officers and the key's in the starboard room below the main deck.
