learn
Some commands (like *set and *oname) change the parameters of things in the game.  This requires you to know the parameter, or FLAG, and what it does.  Again, *dmhelp will guide you. Try [*dmhelp oflags] to see a list of OBJECT flags.
flag
A flag is a binary switch that changes the behavior of something.  You can change the state of a flag with the [*set] command.  Try [*set c care f 2].  This will make me hidden, though you can still talk to me.  If you set the flag again, I will no longer be hidden.  You can use the *dmhelp command to see what flags currently exist. Try [*dmhelp mflags] to see the list of MONSTER flags.

newbies ACTION smile
Newbies are players that are relatively new to Isengard or even mudding in general.  It is important that you help these players learn how to play, as they provide a great deal of new and exciting input into the game.  Our goal is to make every newbie into a veteran Isengard player.

rooms
Rooms can be altered by using the commands [*app], [*name], [*delete], and [*set r].  You should never alter a room's FLAGS unless you are the person that created it, or you have been given permission.  Altering the long and short of a room is allowed for the purpose of spelling correction.  If you would like to have a room to work on, talk to a DM.  They can create one for you.
