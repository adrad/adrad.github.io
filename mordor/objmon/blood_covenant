				RUTGER'S COVENANT

		This covenant is between the undersigned and Rutger,
		first born of King Lyanden and Prince of the Realm, 
		Defender of the Church, Master of the Light and the
		Dark, and the one true heir to his father's throne.

		Rutger hereby recognizes you as a famous adventurer
		and fighter, and one who is independent and a leader
		unto himself.  For your pledge and fealty, and promise
		to subdue the illegal forces of Ragnar, second born
		to King Lyanden, Rutger will give you all the rights
		and privileges of the most noble born in the kingdom.

		No court will hold you liable if you kill any of those
		who have sworn allegiance to Ragnar, and you may take of
		their inventory, and of their armor and weapons, and no
		person may speak out against you for this action.

		Any adventurer who pledges his loyalty to me and then
		kills Ragnar, will be elevated in level and will forever
		help me rule this kingdom.  As the Lord is my witness.
							-- Rutger
