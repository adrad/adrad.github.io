Notice:
	New area flags may be in use in some of the areas inside
this gate, should something 'odd' happen, do not complain to the
first DM you see saying it was a bug, cause its not :)
	Only a few of the areas inside are open.
	Enter at your own risk, if something is wrong inside and
you die because of it, as stated above its probably not a bug,
but could be a mistake, in which case play at your own risk...
